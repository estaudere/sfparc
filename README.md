## Updating your information

Make a PR to the [**people.json**](static/people.json) file. Once approved and merged, the website will have to be manually redployed by the approver.

## Development (for engineers)

`npm install` and `npm run dev` to start the development server. `npm run build` will build the production version (a static Svelte site).

If you have made changes to the site, you will have to manually redploy on the Render dashboard to see the changes live.
